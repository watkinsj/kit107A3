generate a new level:

given	variable t is gameTree
		variable k is a stack of tNodes

get tNode from top of stack call it parent_tnode
get gamestate from parent patent_tnode call it parent_game_state


figure out if a new level is valid etc:
	create new game state with derive
	create tNode from game state
		data is -> gamestate
		level is current level + 1 
	set gamestates parent to parent_tnode
	if first run
		set parent_tnode shild to new tnode
	if > first
		set tnode from before to sinling to new tnode





	The algorythm i want:

		get a game tree from the stack

		generate levels for that game tree

			add all siblings etc for that level to the stack

		if the game tree is deep enough end
		
		otherwise
			repeat until
